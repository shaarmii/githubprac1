"Focus on your own path. The only person you should try to be better than is the person you were yesterday."
"Don't compare your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20. Stay focused on your own journey and watch the magic unfold."
"Your journey is unique. Don't diminish your progress by comparing it to others. Celebrate where you are."
