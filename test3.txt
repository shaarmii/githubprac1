Sarah had always been terrified of public speaking, often avoiding presentations and speaking in front of groups at all costs.
However, one day, she was asked to give a presentation at work.
 Instead of declining, Sarah decided to face her fear head-on.
She practiced her speech multiple times and visualized herself delivering it confidently. 
On the day of the presentation, she felt nervous but took deep breaths to calm herself. 
As she began speaking, Sarah focused on her prepared content and the supportive faces in the audience. 
To her surprise, the presentation went smoothly, and she received positive feedback. 
This experience taught Sarah that preparation and positive thinking were key in overcoming her stage fear.
 From that day on, she became more confident in her public speaking abilities and even volunteered for more opportunities to speak in front of groups.
